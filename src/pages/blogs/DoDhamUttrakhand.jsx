                It has been about 6-8 months since we all started working on the
                Marriott Project, but now we are all thinking of going
                somewhere, we all mean me, Maneesh, Sohel, Saranya, Shubha,
                Aarti and Madhu. I, Maneesh, Sohel, Saranya and Shubha are from
                FE Team, and Aarti and Madhu are from AEM Team. A couple of
                months ago, Maneesh and I were thinking of going to Kedarnath,
                Maneesh told me that Sohel will also come with us, maybe Maneesh
                and Sohel were already planning to go to Kedarnath. I also
                agreed to go at that time. But we had not fixed any date, anyway
                the trek to Kedarnath is opened only in the month of May, this
                trek remains open for 6 months. The rest of the time the road
                remains covered with snow, the snow removal work is completed in
                the month of April.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                We were searching for a touring company. Maneesh knew a company
                named HTC (Hyderabad Touring Company) who could take us to
                Kedarnath. Maneesh talked to HTC and said that they are taking a
                batch on 22nd May. After a lot of discussion, we booked Delhi to
                Delhi package and shared our leave plan with the team. In this
                tour package, they will take us to visit two Dhams (Kedarnath
                and Badrinath). There was also rafting and Ganga Aarti on the
                last day of the plan. We were very excited.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                Days were passing slowly and we were wondering when 21st May
                would come. We were eagerly waiting for 21st May but going on a
                trip together was not that easy. April turned into May. It was
                around 2 pm on 3rd May when we received a Quick-Connect email
                from the project manager. It was Friday today and they had
                scheduled a meeting on Monday - 6th May at 1:30 pm. We were
                worried that they might ask us to reschedule the vacation. We
                had already paid 35k in advance to HTC for the trip booking. If
                the trip was rescheduled, this money would not be refunded.
                Another problem was that we had to clear the remaining payment
                by 12 pm on 6th May. If we were unable to pay the remaining
                payment on that day, the trip slots we had booked by paying 35k
                would get cancelled. There was a quick connect meeting at 1:30
                on the same day. We told HTC that we would be able to make the
                payment by evening. HTC agreed. Now we were all waiting to take
                the next step based on what would happen in the 1:30 meeting. If
                the project people ask for trip reschedule, we would ask to
                reimburse the trip slot booking amount.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                We joined the meeting at 1:30. There were many people in the
                meeting DL, but some of them did not join the meeting. Then
                after 5 minutes Komal joined the meeting. Komal did not ask us
                to cancel the trip plans directly, but they wanted some of us to
                reschedule our vacation because the search was going to go live
                in May last and they wanted maximum people to be available at
                that time, so that if any major problem arises, we can handle it
                easily. This meeting must have lasted for 15 minutes, then at
                last it was confirmed that if needed then you people can work
                during the weekend so that the delivery of the product is not
                affected. We all agreed. We all were very happy, in the evening
                we also paid the pending amount of HTC, they said that a week
                before the trip they will create a WhatsApp group and provide
                all the details. Finally now it felt that there will be no
                problem in going on the trip.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                Slowly, the remaining days passed, and only one week was left
                before the trip. HTC held a meeting to explain what to bring and
                what not to bring on the trip. They also explained the day-wise
                plan, including where we would go and where we would stay. Two
                days later, HTC held another meeting and made some changes to
                the trip. Due to heavy crowds at Kedarnath, there were severe
                traffic jams, so they removed rafting and the Ganga Aarti from
                the trip plan and also changed some hotel stay locations. We
                didn't want to go without rafting. How could we come to
                Rishikesh and not do rafting? So, we planned to stay in
                Rishikesh for rafting and the Ganga Aarti after Kedarnath and
                Badrinath. However, there was an issue: Shubha and Madhu had
                already booked their return flight tickets. We were unsure
                whether to skip rafting and the Ganga Aarti and return to Delhi
                with HTC or let Shubha and Madhu return with HTC while the rest
                of us stayed in Rishikesh for an extra day to do these
                activities before returning.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                Since we had booked a Delhi-to-Delhi package, HTC had to drop us
                off in Delhi. Shubha and Madhu suggested that we stay in
                Rishikesh on the last day, and they would return to Delhi with
                HTC. We all agreed because we didn't know when we would get
                another chance to come to Rishikesh, and we didn't want to leave
                without rafting. Though it didn't feel good that Shubha and
                Madhu couldn't join us, there was no other way. Then Saranya,
                Aarti, Maneesh, and Sohel also booked their return flights. I
                was the only one traveling by train. We were all coming to Delhi
                from our respective locations, and since Delhi was 350
                kilometers from my home, it was easy for me to reach. The rest
                were coming from different states: Sohel from Odisha, Madhu from
                Hyderabad airport, Shubha from Bengaluru airport, Aarti from
                Belagavi airport in Karnataka, and Saranya and Maneesh from
                Chennai airport.

              <p className="sub-para">
                Finally, the day had come for us to set out on our trip. As I
                mentioned before, we were all coming from different states,
                except for Maneesh and Saranya, who were on the same flight. I
                had booked a 7:00 A.M. train from Kanpur Central to Delhi, so I
                needed to get to Kanpur from Kannauj, which is 75 kilometers
                away. I woke up around 2:00 A.M. because I still had some
                packing to do. After finishing all my tasks, I was ready by 4:00
                A.M. and reached Kannauj railway station by 4:30 A.M. There was
                a train at 4:30 A.M. from Kannauj that would take me to Kanpur
                Central.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                The train was on time, and I reached Kanpur Central by 6:30 A.M.
                Now, I had to wait for the train to Delhi. Today, the train was
                a bit late, but that was okay. I bought some snacks for the
                journey and started passing the time on my phone. We had created
                a WhatsApp group called "Chalo Kedarnath," and people had
                started messaging on it, mostly wishing everyone a happy
                journey. Madhu and Aarti had also left for the airport from
                their homes. Around 8:30 A.M., the train arrived, an hour late,
                but it didn't matter since we had plenty of time to spend in
                Delhi. Our bus was scheduled to pick us up from Kashmiri Gate at
                11:00 P.M. and take us to Rishikesh.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                Maneesh and Saranya's flight was at 11:30 A.M., and they had
                reached Chennai airport. I started watching the web series
                "Better Call Saul" on my phone. It's based on the character Saul
                Goodman from the "Breaking Bad" series, which I really liked,
                along with the character of Saul Goodman. While watching the web
                series, I kept checking messages from our group. The four-hour
                journey passed quickly, and before I knew it, the time had flown
                by. The train didn't have any stops between Kanpur and Delhi,
                but it mostly stopped at the outer signal of the stations if the
                signal wasn't clear.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                Around 12:00 PM, Sohel arrived at Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport.
                Shortly after, Aarti reached Terminal 2, and Madhu arrived at
                Terminal 1. We had initially decided to meet at Terminal 1 for
                lunch and then explore Delhi. I reached Delhi around 1:30 PM and
                got off at Anand Vihar station. From there, I took a ticket to
                Terminal 1, which was about 30 kilometers away with a total of
                23 stations in between. I had to change metro lines three times.
                Maneesh and Saranya were arriving at Terminal 3, so we decided
                to meet there instead. By 2:00 PM, Maneesh and Saranya had also
                reached Terminal 3, and Shubha arrived by 2:30 PM.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                I reached Terminal 1 by 2:30 PM and then took a Rapido to
                Terminal 3, arriving around 3:10 PM. The distance between
                Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 was about 3 kilometers, but due to
                traffic, it took me about 30 minutes. Saranya had shared the
                live location on the group, so I had no trouble finding them.
                They were sitting outside KFC. Except for Maneesh, I hadn't met
                anyone else in person before, although I recognized everyone
                thanks to the video call meetings organized by the project team.
                These meetings were supposedly for increasing productivity, but
                in reality, we all knew their true purpose. Anyway, no one
                attends those meetings anymore. As I greeted everyone and shook
                hands, they introduced themselves. I said, "Hey, I recognize
                everyone!" They had already finished their lunch and were just
                waiting for me. They were sitting outside KFC because, as Sohel
                explained, the AC inside wasn't working, so they chose to sit
                outside despite the heat.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                I was really struggling with the heat, and the problem was that
                I was wearing a black t-shirt with an open black shirt over it.
                Sohel even joked, "Arpit looks like he's dressed as if it is
                snowing in Delhi" They were waiting for me and offered me some
                sweets. Finally, we were about to start our trip, and everyone's
                faces were lit up with joy. Initially, I was worried that we
                might have to reschedule the trip. I thought that out of the
                seven of us who planned the trip, at least one or two might
                cancel, but that didn't happen. We all kept our promises, or
                perhaps the reason was that we had already paid HTC, and if you
                didn't go on the trip, the money wouldn't be refunded, nor could
                you send someone else in your place. Maybe that's why we had
                full attendance. Then I asked where we should go now, as our bus
                was at 11:00 PM, so we had plenty of time to explore.

                However, roaming around Delhi in the summer isn't easy, and we
                had a lot of luggage, almost everyone had two bags. We decided
                to head to New Delhi Metro Station first and then decide where
                to go. We bought tickets from Terminal 3 Metro Station to New
                Delhi and waited for the metro. It arrived in a minute or two,
                and we set off for New Delhi station. During the ride, we took a
                lot of selfies, which were the first group photos of the trip. I
                don't remember what we were discussing while sitting in the
                metro, but we were the only ones making noise, similar to how
                students create a ruckus when the teacher is absent. After
                reaching New Delhi, we looked for the cloakroom. The New Delhi
                station is quite large, and none of us had been there before,
                but after asking around, we eventually found the cloakroom.

                We put some smaller bags inside the larger ones and finally
                submitted all the large bags. It felt a bit better since
                everyone's bags were very heavy, and you can't even imagine
                carrying them around Delhi in the summer. But the problem was
                that we still hadn't confirmed where we were going to visit.
                Sohel was suggesting Connaught Place, though I'm not sure why,
                as there were no other places on his list. We all agreed, so we
                bought tickets from New Delhi to Rajiv Chowk. Officially,
                Connaught Place is named Rajiv Chowk. The British had named it
                Connaught Place, and it was once the largest market in India.
                The area features Georgian-style buildings with columns, famous
                chain stores from around the world, old theaters, bars, and
                Indian restaurants. In 2013, it was officially renamed Rajiv
                Chowk, but people still mostly refer to it as CP.

                There are a total of 8 gates at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station, and
                as far as I remember, we exited from Gate 2. After wandering
                around a bit, we took some pictures. The selfies weren't turning
                out very well, but Aarti took some photos where, although she
                wasn't in them, the six of us looked quite good. We then headed
                to Palika Bazaar, which was within walking distance. This market
                is also quite old, established in 1979. It's an underground,
                air-conditioned market, a good place to visit in the summer.
                There are around 380 shops here, mainly selling electronics and
                garments. I needed to buy a raincoat, and the others weren't
                specifically looking for anything, but if they found something
                good, they would buy it.

              <p className="sub-para">
                While we were looking around, Sohel spotted an Indian team
                jersey and bought it after checking a couple of stores. Saranya,
                Shubha, Madhu, and Aarti were looking at footwear stores,
                probably for slippers. I kept asking for raincoats, but everyone
                kept telling me that it was not the season for raincoats and
                suggested checking another shop, which didn't help. After
                looking at two or three shops, I realized that finding a
                raincoat here was unlikely. We spent about 1 to 2 hours at
                Palika Bazaar, and after getting quite tired from walking, we
                sat down for 10-15 minutes to rest before heading out of the
                market.

                It was evening, and the temperature outside had dropped a bit.
                We were thinking of grabbing some food and drinks. The girls
                stopped at a stall selling pani puri, while Maneesh had chole
                and samosa, and Sohel and I opted for bhel puri. After eating,
                we headed to a nearby park known as Central Park. The park
                didn't have an entry fee, but it was quite crowded at that time,
                mostly with couples and people who seemed to be aspiring
                Instagram stars, busy creating reels in hopes that one day they
                might go viral and become overnight sensations. We were the only
                ones there just to pass the time, and we couldn't find a proper
                spot to sit as every place was occupied by couples. We didn't
                want to disturb them since they had come to spend quality time
                together.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                After searching for a while, we finally found a spot where no
                one else was sitting. We chose a place where we wouldn't bother
                anyone else. Madhu also felt like making a reel after seeing
                others, but she didn't have anyone to help her at that moment.
                Even though she is very skilled at dancing, she chose not to
                make a solo video. Maneesh was talking about some Tamil words
                whose meanings were quite different in Hindi, and we had a good
                laugh. We chatted, ate the sweets we had brought from home, took
                selfies, and by the time we had done all this, the guard came
                around blowing his whistle and asking everyone to leave the
                park.

                We had only been sitting for about 20-30 minutes and didn't want
                to leave yet. It felt quite pleasant as the temperature dropped
                with the evening, making it enjoyable to sit there. Eventually,
                we chatted and made our way out of the park. Except for Madhu,
                everyone else could understand and speak Hindi fairly well.
                Madhu could understand and speak only a few Hindi words. I
                remember several times when I would explain something to her,
                and she would respond with, "Hey, I didn't understand. Can you
                tell me in English?"
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                We walked out of the park and began searching for a good
                restaurant for dinner. After asking around, we found out that
                there was a popular restaurant nearby called "Jain Chawal Wala."
                The name sounded a bit unusual, but we were eager to try some
                Delhi-style chole bhature. The restaurant was close by, so we
                walked over and most of us ordered chole bhature. The place was
                quite crowded, and it took us about 5 to 10 minutes to get our
                food. Unfortunately, the chole was too salty, and nobody enjoyed
                it much. We managed to eat it somehow. Afterwards, we needed to
                return to New Delhi Station where our luggage was stored. We
                picked up our Bags from New Delhi station's clockroom and then
                bought tickets to Kashmiri Gate. It was around 10 PM, and
                Kashmiri Gate was three stations away from New Delhi Station,
                approximately 3 kilometers. We reached Kashmiri Gate in about 10
                minutes and went to Gate No. 2 of the metro station, where we
                sat on the stairs to wait for an hour.

                Our clothes were ruined from the heat of the day, so some of us
                changed into fresh clothes in a nearby changing room to make the
                night journey more comfortable. Our tickets were for
                air-conditioned sleeper seats, but all the seats were just for
                sitting. We sat on the stairs outside Kashmiri Gate Metro
                Station, We were sitting on the stairs outside Kashmiri Gate.
                Some people from the group were going down the stairs and coming
                up by lift to pass time. Once or twice it happened that the poor
                guys went down the stairs but as soon as they reached down, the
                lift going up stopped. I don't remember exactly who it was, but
                we all had a good laugh. It was already 11 PM, and there was
                still no news about the bus. We found out the bus would arrive
                at 12 AM, so we had to wait another hour. How we spent that
                hour, only we know, especially with the mosquitoes bothering us.

                We were all keeping an eye on the buses that were stopping. At
                around 12:20 a bus stops. We rush to see if we have to go by
                this bus. The bus number is different but we had to go by this
                bus. The bus number that was written on the ticket had some
                issues and this bus had come in its place. We quickly put all
                our luggage in the luggage compartment of the bus and went to
                our seats. Everyone had separate seats. Then we exchanged some
                seats. Saranya and Aarti were sitting in the front, then Madhu.
                Leaving 5-6 seats, I was sitting behind Maneesh and Sohel and
                Shubha were sitting on the other side of Maneesh. We had not
                taken out any jacket or blanket from our bags and as the bus was
                moving towards Rishikesh, the temperature in the bus was
                decreasing. Shubha had even put on a sweater while sitting in
                the bus. I took out my denim jacket from my bag and wore it
                after 10-15 minutes. The jackets of the rest of the people were
                in the bags kept in the luggage compartment.

              <p className="sub-para">
                I don't know when I fell asleep. Around 4:00 am, the bus stops
                at a petrol pump. At that time, Saranya and Aarti are looking
                for the bus driver. Perhaps they were unable to sleep because of
                the cold. We even called the bus driver but he did not agree to
                take out the luggage. Then we sit in the bus with the hope that
                we will reach Rishikesh soon. Rishikesh was still around 130 to
                140 kms away. We reach Rishikesh in an hour or two. The bus
                drops us at a location called Nepali Farm.

                sitting on the other side of Madhu. We had kept all the bags on
                the roof of the van but we kept the smaller ones with us. We had
                a long journey and we still had to have breakfast. The driver
                told us that he would stop a little further where we could
                freshen up and have breakfast.

                The van must have travelled a kilometer and then the police had
                blocked the road to Rishikesh. They were stopping the vehicles
                and checking their registrations and then allowing the vehicles
                to go to Rishikesh. The driver parked the van on one side of the
                road and we started waiting for our turn. The driver got out of
                the van and went to the police booth. The vehicles that came
                after us were showing their registration to the police and
                leaving. We were unable to understand why it was taking us so
                much time. Actually, there was a lot of crowd in Rishikesh in
                those days and that is why the police administration was a
                little strict.

                People without registration were not being allowed to go to
                Rishikesh. Then the driver came back to the van. We were asking
                him why the police was not allowing us to go. He was not telling
                anything clearly. Then he said that there was some problem with
                Aarti's registration. It was a different date. Actually, the
                matter there was something else. The registrations of all of us
                were fake. HTC had just changed the date while editing the PDF.
                We were all worried about what would happen now. Some were
                worried about how we would send the photos of Kedarnath to our
                families. It was a long journey for my friends, almost everyone
                had come from a distance of more than 2000 kms. I was thinking
                that if the police did not let us go, then where would we go for
                these 7 days.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                Maneesh and Sohel were discussing that if we could not go to
                Kedarnath, we would ask for a refund from HTC and if they did
                not give it, we would file a case in the consumer court. They
                were even discussing whether any of us knew a good advocate who
                could file a case against HTC. We got down from the van and
                started walking here and there. There was a guy named "Makkhan"
                from HTC who was the guide. We would sometimes ask Makkhan and
                sometimes the driver if any solution was found or not, how long
                would we have to wait. But they had no answer.

                It was almost 9-9:30 while waiting. The driver asked everyone to
                sit in the van. We were very happy. We don't know how they had
                deal with the policemen. Did they pay the policemen on Google
                Pay or gave them cash. Only HTC people would know. It didn't
                matter to us, we had already paid for the trip. The road was
                single lane. The van was moving at a speed of 40 to 50. There
                was a ditch on one side of the road and the Ganges river was
                flowing below it. There was a mountain on the other side. The
                view was very captivating. We started taking nature photos.
                Mountains were visible far and wide.

                At around 11:30 the van stops in front of a restaurant. We had
                to freshen up and have breakfast there. We were not able to sit
                on one table. So Aarti and Madhu were sitting on one table and
                I, Shubha, Sohel, Saranya and Maneesh were sitting on the other
                table. We ordered Aloo ka Paratha and tea. There was a very good
                view of the Ganga river in front of the restaurant. After having
                breakfast, we went to the other side of the road to take
                selfies. After clicking some good photos, we sat in the van. The
                AC of the van was not working. Due to traffic, the van was
                stopping again and again and when the van stopped, it was very
                hot. We had to travel the whole day today. The van was moving at
                a speed of 50-60.

                We had to go to Sonprayag via Devprayag, Srinagar, Rudraprayag,
                Augustmuni, Guptkashi. We had not yet reached Devprayag. After 1
                hour, we reached Devprayag. In Devprayag, the Alaknanda river
                meets the Bhagirathi river. Beyond the confluence, this combined
                river is called the Ganga river. According to the belief, an
                ascetic named Dev Sharma did severe penance here, after which
                this place was named Devprayag. We do not stop at Devprayag, we
                just sit in the van and watch the scene. After a while we asked
                driver to stop the van. Actually we had to buy some medicine
                etc., some people had to withdraw money from the ATM. The van
                must have stopped for about 10-15 minutes after which it starts
                again.

                The heat was unbearable for everyone. The road was quite uneven
                and winding, and although the driver was skilled, he took the
                turns at high speed. We were sitting at the very back, which
                made it quite uncomfortable. Sometimes we had to steady
                ourselves, and at other times, we had to manage the small bags
                behind us. I nearly fell off my seat a couple of times. Despite
                the challenges, we were enjoying the journey. On one side of the
                road, there was Mandakini river, and on the other side,
                mountains. We even saw some landslides on the road. In some
                places, soil was being cleared from the road, and a couple of
                spots looked particularly dangerous. There were alert boards
                where there was a possibility of rocks falling from the
                mountains. However, the view of the mountains was beyond words.
                Shubha captured some great photos and videos along the way.

                We talked a lot during the journey. Maneesh shared many
                childhood pictures, and some were quite funny. Saranya and
                Shubha discussed their engineering percentages, and we got to
                know that Shubha had done a polytechnic diploma. I, too, had
                taken admission in engineering after completing a diploma.
                Discussing these things, we stopped at a restaurant. I wasn't
                hungry, and the others didn't eat much either. We bought some
                water, cold drinks and snacks, took some photos outside the
                restaurant, and captured lots of group and solo photos. On the
                other side of the restaurant, beautiful Mandakini River was
                flowing. There was a place to walk around near the river, so we
                strolled there for about 10-15 minutes, took photos, and then
                got back in the van. Some people were still outside. After
                waiting for a long time, we asked the driver why we were still
                not starting journey. He told us there was a police check ahead
                and that we would continue in evening once it got darker. It
                felt strange, but we stayed in the van. Eventually, it started
                raining, and the driver covered the bags on the roof. Tired of
                sitting in the van then we got out. Shubha, Saranya, and I sat
                in front of the restaurant, discussing random things. Maneesh
                was sleeping in the van, and Madhu and Aarti were also inside.
                Sohel was sitting in front of the river, along with a couple of
                others who were traveling with us in the van.

                After a while, we also went to the riverbank and sat there for
                quite some time. We talked, listened to the sound of the flowing
                river, and sometimes threw stones into it. Around 5:00 PM, the
                driver asked us to get back in the van, and we finally started
                moving again. However, there was heavy traffic on the road, so
                the van couldn't go fast, and it was already dark. The van
                continued this way for about 6-7 hours. Some of us fell asleep,
                while others were on their phones. I also dozed off a couple of
                times without realizing it. But around 1-2 AM, there was a
                massive traffic jam. Because of the jam, the van dropped us
                about 1-2 kilometers before Sitapur at around 3:00 AM.

                We get down from the van, took our bags, and started walking
                towards Sitapur. Sitapur is just before Sonprayag, and HTC had
                booked a hotel there. We reached the hotel in 30-40 minutes.
                Makhan Singh told us to be ready by 6:00 AM and left. We had
                about 1-2 hours to rest. It was the second day in a row that we
                couldn't get proper sleep. Besides Maneesh, Sohel, and me, three
                more people were staying in our room. Two of them were brothers,
                and the third was a friend of the elder brother. All three were
                very nice guys. The girls in our group had a room across the
                hall from ours. We managed to rest for about 2 hours that day.

                We were ready by 6:00 AM. We asked Makhan where to store the
                extra bags, and he placed them all in a room. We decided to take
                just one bag with us, packing only the essentials like woolen
                jackets, thermals, woolen socks, a power bank, and medicines.
                Even with just the basics, the bag felt heavy. Makhan had
                advised us the night before to keep our bags as light as
                possible because the lighter the bag, the easier the trek would
                be. In the morning, we submitted our fitness certificates and

                take a jeep. There was a long line to board the jeep, which
                started right in front of the tea shop. We quietly stood near
                the line. First, two or three of us got in, and then the rest of
                us joined behind them. We had to be careful so the police
                wouldn't see that we were joining in the middle instead of at
                the end. if we had joined the end of the line, we would have had
                to walk back about 200 meters, which we wanted to avoid.

                On the other side of the road, vendors were selling trekking
                essentials like sticks, gloves, raincoats, and shoes. We bought
                trekking sticks, which are quite important. At first, I thought
                we wouldn't need them, but I was wrong. We slowly moved forward
                in the line, but the jeep stand was still not in sight. Along
                the way, we had to get our registration verified at another
                point, which made us a bit worried that there might be an issue.
                However, Makhan assured us that the registration problem was
                resolved, and everything was fine now. After getting our
                registration verified, we continued walking towards the main
                road. after covering about 1.5 km, We finally reached on main
                road. On the other side of the road was a beautiful river, so we
                stopped there to wait for the others, hoping we could all take
                the same jeep to Gaurikund. We took some great photos while we
                waited. Once everyone arrived, we headed to Gaurikund by jeep.
                After reaching Gaurikund, we took a break to have breakfast, and
                then we finally started our trek to Kedarnath Temple.

                We would occasionally walk behind the palanquins because they
                made it easier to navigate the path. The palanquin carriers
                cleared the way as they moved, so staying behind them meant we
                could walk without any interruptions. However, some of us
                couldn't keep up because the palanquins moved pretty fast. The
                path was also very dirty, mainly due to the horses used on the
                trek. The horse riders were quite careless and rushed, making it
                difficult for us to walk. After about an hour of walking, we
                reached a spot where we filled our bottles with hot water.
                Throughout the Kedarnath trek, water flows down from the
                mountains in various places, and the locals use this water. We
                also filled our bottles with it at one of these spots. After
                walking for another 10 to 20 minutes, Madhu realized she
                couldn't continue on foot and decided it would be better to ride
                a horse.

              <p className="sub-para">
                We asked around at a few places for the rates, some quoted 5000
                rupees, others 5500. Finally, one horse owner offered 4500, and
                Madhu found the deal reasonable. She continued the rest of the
                journey on horseback. The horses take you up to the base camp,
                after which you have to walk the remaining 2 kilometers to reach
                the Kedarnath temple. We planned to stay at the base camp
                overnight since the temple closes at 8:00 PM, and we knew we
                wouldn't reach it until after that.

                After Madhu left, the six of us continued walking slowly, taking
                short breaks along the way. Aarti was leading the group, walking
                steadily without stopping much, followed by Sohel and then me.
                Shubha, Saranya, and Maneesh were all walking together behind
                us. We were all eager to complete the trek as soon as possible.
                We hadn't taken many photos so far. It was around 1:00 PM, and
                we had only completed about four or five kilometers of the trek.
                Suddenly it started raining. We all stopped at one place, wore
                raincoats and continued trekking. We knew it was a long journey
                ahead, and the further we went, the more tired we would get. By
                2:00 PM, we stopped at a shop and ordered Maggi and tea. The
                entire trekking route is dotted with small shops where you can
                find water and soft drinks. The shop we stopped at was made of
                wooden planks, with a yellow canvas roof that cast a yellow hue
                over the entire shop.

                There were two men running the shop, a father and son. The son
                looked about 30-35 years old, and the father around 55-60. It
                took them about 30-35 minutes to make the tea and Maggi, but
                both were delicious. We took a few pictures while eating, and
                with the yellow light from the canvas, the photos looked like we
                were sitting in a relief camp after being rescued from a flood
                or something.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                After eating, we continued our trek. The rain was still falling,
                and it was getting really warm under the raincoats. The path had
                become muddy, so we had to walk carefully. We split into groups
                of three: I was with Aarti and Sohel, while Shubha, Saranya, and
                Maneesh were together. Our group was ahead, but we would wait
                for the others after walking a bit. By 3:30 PM, we reached a
                point where the path split into two. We stopped there to wait
                for Shubha, Saranya, and Maneesh and asked some policemen on
                duty which path we should take. Soon, the others caught up.
                Maneesh's ankle had swollen, so he took a break to rest. After
                resting for about 10-15 minutes, we chose the first route. This
                path soon led to a bridge where we crossed the Mandakini River
                to the other side.

                We stopped on the bridge to take some pictures and asked someone
                who was returning from Kedarnath to take a group photo for us.
                The photo turned out great, but we noticed later that someone
                else had accidentally gotten into the shot, looking like they
                were part of our group. Till now the Mandakini river was on the
                right side of the track, from the time we crossed the bridge,
                the Mandakini river remains on the left side of the track till
                the Kedarnath temple. The route that we had selected, no horses,
                mules etc. were going on it, due to this it was quite easy for
                us to walk. After a while, this track merged with the main
                trekking route.

                Saranya, Shubha and Maneesh were quite behind on the trek. It
                was around 5:00 o'clock and I, Sohel and Aarti started using the
                shortcut from the track. There were three advantages of the
                shortcut, first, we would not find any horse, palanquin on the
                way, second, there were less people on the way and third and
                most important, we had to walk less. We used every shortcut we
                could find. We stopped at one spot to have tea, which was at a
                beautiful location with a great view of the valley. Aarti asked
                to take some photos while having tea. The pictures turned out
                great, so Sohel and I took a few more.

                We waited there for Shubha, Saranya, and Maneesh. When we called
                them, we realized we had gotten pretty far ahead, and it would
                take them some time to catch up. After resting for 10-15
                minutes, we resumed trekking. Saranya, Shubha, and Maneesh were
                having difficulty walking and were taking more breaks. As the
                evening progressed, Shubha seemed to be losing her energy,
                though I can't say that for sure. What was certain, though, was
                that the cold was increasing. My bag was with Maneesh, and I had
                Maneesh's bag. Since Maneesh was struggling with the trek, I
                gave him my bag, which was lighter, to make it easier for him. I
                didn't know what to wear, Sohel had a jacket of Maneesh in his
                bag, so I wore that, and Aarti had been wearing a jacket since
                the start of the trip.

              <p className="sub-para">
                Around 6:45 PM, we saw snow-covered mountains in the distance. I
                can never forget that sight. It was sunset, and the red sunlight
                was making the snowy peaks glow. That view took away a lot of
                our fatigue. We took some photos and continued on the trek,
                noticing snow in some places along the way. By 7:30 PM, it was
                getting hard to see the path properly. We kept taking shortcuts,
                but some were so long that we wondered if we had taken the wrong
                route. Fortunately, they always led back to the main track. We
                were still about 4 kilometers from the base camp, and the higher
                altitude made it difficult to breathe. The lower oxygen levels
                made us tire quickly, so we were taking frequent breaks.

                My torch was in the bag with Maneesh, so we used the flashlights
                on our phones to light the way. There were lights on the
                trekking routes, but it was challenging to walk in the dark on
                the shortcuts. The last 4 kilometers were tough, and you can
                only truly understand how we completed them if you've been on
                the Kedarnath trek yourself. As we neared the base camp, the
                cold increased. It was nighttime, and the low oxygen made us
                tire quickly, so we had to keep taking breaks.

                After trekking for an hour and a half and resting for an hour,
                we finally reached the base camp at 9:00 PM. There, we contacted
                Makkhan, who took us to our tent. We were going to rest here for
                the night. The Kedarnath temple was still about one and a half
                kilometers away from here. The cold was intense. I quickly set
                my bag aside and wrapped myself in the quilt. I was so exhausted
                that I didn't even want to have dinner.

                Saranya, Shubha, and Maneesh were far behind us. They also chose
                shortcuts wherever they found them. During one of these
                shortcuts, they got a beautiful view of the Himalayas. Just like
                us, their fatigue vanished after seeing the view. They enjoyed
                the moment, clicked some photos, and continued trekking. They
                still had about 3 kilometers to go. They were very tired and now
                wanted to cover the remaining distance on horseback. Horse
                owners were demanding ₹3000, but finally, one agreed to take
                them to the base camp for ₹600 per person. So, they completed
                the remaining 3 kilometers on horseback.

                By the time we reached the base camp, I had already spoken to
                Maneesh, and they had just started riding on the horses. After
                resting in the tent for 30 minutes, I, Sohel, and Aarti went for
                dinner. After eating, we were just sitting when I received a
                phone call from someone who started speaking in Tamil. I
                couldn't understand a word. It was probably someone from the HTC
                group asking for the base camp location. When we had reached the
                base camp, I had posted a message in the HTC WhatsApp group
                saying "finally reached the base camp," and it seems that
                someone called after seeing that message.

                Then I received a call from Saranya saying that they were also
                about to reach and asking for the tent's location. I told her to
                call me as soon as they arrived. Finding the tent was difficult,
                mainly because the tents were addressed by the numbers on the
                poles. It was around 11:00 PM when they finally reached the base
                camp. As soon as Saranya called me again, I came out of the tent
                to meet them. After walking about 50 meters, I saw them, and
                they were quite happy. I was also relieved that they had arrived
                quickly by horseback; otherwise, it would have taken them until
                midnight or 1:00 AM to reach.

                Riding on a horse at night was an adventure in itself. It was
                dark, so the horse couldn't walk properly. At one point,
                Shubha's horse slipped, and Shubha thought that her time had
                come, but somehow the horse regained its balance and didn't let
                her fall. Saranya, on the other hand, seemed to have a lifelong
                enmity with horses. Throughout the trek, she had to be very
                careful to avoid them.

                Finally, when they arrived, I took my bag from Maneesh and gave

                my bag and put them on. Saranya, Shubha and Maneesh were so
                tired that they didn't even eat food. They came and started
                resting. Other people had already slept. We also slept early
                because we had to wake up early in the morning at 4:00 and leave
                for Darshan by 5:30 AM.

                Just 100-200 meters before the temple, there was a line of
                people collecting tokens. Sohel and Maneesh went ahead to check
                if we needed one. Meanwhile, the rest of us were asking around
                at the nearby shops for the best price on Prasad (holy
                offering). Aarti managed to negotiate the price down from ₹200
                to ₹150 per packet. You might wonder why we were haggling over
                Prasad, but the shopkeepers were charging way too much, and we
                didn't have many options. With the Prasad in hand, we moved
                closer to the temple. After crossing a bridge, we turned left
                and soon saw a line of devotees waiting for darshan (sight of
                the deity). We joined the queue, but Sohel called us back,
                saying we could take a direct route to the temple.

                We followed the road straight in front of the bridge and finally
                reached the temple premises. Seeing the temple for the first
                time in person, after only ever seeing it in photos and videos,
                was a moment of reward for all our efforts. The temple was even
                more beautiful than any picture could capture, surrounded by
                snow-covered mountains that glistened in the sunlight. It was an
                indescribable sight, with waterfalls cascading down the
                mountains like streams of milk. Nestled in the lap of the
                Himalayas, the Kedarnath Temple stands at an elevation of 3,583
                meters above sea level. It's a key part of the Char Dham
                pilgrimage which is a major journey in Hinduism. The temple was
                established in the 8th century by Adi Shankaracharya, a pivotal
                figure in Hinduism who founded many temples to revive and
                promote Hindu beliefs and spread Vedanta philosophy.

                Kedarnath was one of these sacred sites. But the story of
                Kedarnath is even older, intertwined with the epic Mahabharata.
                It's one of the five Kedars—along with Tungnath, Rudranath,
                Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar—where different forms of Lord
                Shiva are worshipped. All these temples are situated in
                high-altitude regions, each one offering a unique glimpse into
                the divine. The architecture of Kedarnath Temple is remarkable.
                It's constructed from large stone slabs, and remarkably, no
                cement was used to bind the stones. This ancient method has
                helped the temple survive through the ages. We reached the back
                gate of the temple, where there were many police officers on
                duty. Those who knew the priests or the temple staff were
                allowed to enter directly. We waited there, hoping to get our
                chance to go inside.

                Somehow, Madhu and Aarti managed to enter, followed by Sohel and
                Maneesh. That left just me, Shubha, and Saranya outside. After
                about 10-15 minutes, we also found an opportunity and went
                inside the temple. The crowd inside was dense, but we managed to
                have darshan within 10-15 minutes. By 6:15 AM, we were all done
                with the temple visit and began exploring the temple complex. We
                took some great group photos. Behind the temple, there was a
                large area where we saw the famous Bhim Shila, the massive rock
                that protected the temple during the 2013 disaster.In 2013, the
                region was severely impacted by floods and landslides that
                caused significant damage and loss of life. Despite the
                destruction, the main structure of the Kedarnath Temple survived
                During the disaster because this rock positioned itself behind
                the temple, shielding it from harm. Since then, people have
                started worshipping the rock as well. The sun had risen by now,
                and the mountains were glowing in the sunlight. I had never seen
                snow-covered peaks before, and the sight was truly mesmerizing.
                We spent almost two hours there.

                Every year, Kedarnath's sacredness and divine aura attract
                millions of devotees who come seeking Lord Shiva's blessings. In
                the past, there have been instances where some people, in search
                of spiritual liberation, chose to end their lives at religious
                places like Kedarnath. This was especially common in the high
                mountainous areas around Kedarnath. These individuals believed
                that by doing so, their souls would directly reach heaven or
                achieve liberation. However, such incidents no longer occur.

                While Sohel went to visit Bhairav Baba's temple, the rest of us
                stayed behind the Kedarnath temple, exploring the area and
                taking more photos. We clicked some memorable pictures and then
                I made a phone call home. When I hung up the phone, I realized I
                couldn't find the rest of the group. The temple was crowded, but
                after a few minutes, I found Maneesh, who was also looking for
                everyone else. We called them and found out that Sohel, Shubha,
                and Saranya had already left the temple complex, while Aarti and
                Madhu were shopping nearby. Maneesh and I also checked out some
                shops, and we both liked a wooden model of the Kedarnath Temple,
                which we bought before heading back to the bridge. After a
                while, everyone else joined us, and we started our walk back to
                the base camp.

                By now, our feet were in serious pain. No wonder, considering we
                had walked almost 28 kilometers the day before! Though
                smartphones aren't perfectly accurate, we estimated we had
                covered at least 25 kilometers. On our way back, we saw a
                crashed helicopter, but fortunately, no one was injured, and all
                the passengers were safe. Sohel and I were walking ahead, lost
                in conversation, and accidentally walked about 700-800 meters
                past our tent. Realizing our mistake, we turned back and had
                breakfast. Some of us had Maggi, while others opted for aloo
                paratha. We took our food back to the tent and ate there. I
                still had some sweets left in my bag, so we finished those off
                too. After packing our bags, we started our journey back.

                The first kilometer of the path was relatively easy, with only a
                gentle slope. But once we started taking shortcuts, things got
                tricky. These shortcuts were steep, rocky, and not easy to
                navigate. Some of us lost our walking sticks at the temple
                because we left them outside during the darshan, and they were
                gone by the time we came out. Others still had their sticks, and
                I realized how useful they were for trekking. I used to think
                walking sticks were just for old people, but they really come in
                handy on a trek. Almost all of us slipped at least once on these
                shortcuts. Saranya was the first to fall, and the rest of us had
                our own slips too. I also slipped once, but thankfully, no one
                saw it!

                Though we had gotten about 4-5 hours of rest the previous night,
                the pain in our feet hadn't subsided much. We weren't taking
                many breaks or photos this time, determined to make good
                progress. If you're talking about locations on the trek, there
                are four main spots between Gaurikund and Kedarnath. First, you
                reach Jungle Chatti, 4 kilometers from Gaurikund. Then there's
                Bhimbali, another 3 kilometers ahead, followed by Linchauli,
                which is 4 kilometers further. After Linchauli, it's another 4
                kilometers to the base camp, and from there, it's 1.5 kilometers
                to the Kedarnath Temple.

                of the mountains was stunning, with clouds hanging over the
                valley on one side and towering peaks on the other. We stopped
                there for a break, soaking in the scenery. We stayed for about
                30 minutes, then continued our trek around 12:30 PM, taking
                shortcuts whenever possible. We walked non-stop for about an
                hour, only pausing for a couple of tea breaks. There was still
                some snow melting along the trail, and Maneesh and Sohel had a
                playful snowball fight. Here and there, we spotted flowers
                blooming, and Shubha took a few pictures of them. Along the way,
                we came across a free meal service (bhandara), where they were
                serving dal and rice. We stopped there for lunch, grateful for
                the warm meal.

                One more thing we noticed: we weren't the only ones taking
                shortcuts. The porters who carry people on their backs, just
                like in the movie "Kedarnath," were also using these tricky
                paths. It's an incredibly tough job, as the shortcuts are rough
                and steep, but these porters are so skilled and experienced that

                walking. We were still about 2 kilometers away from Bhimbali. At
                this point, we came across two trekking routes. The day before,
                we had taken Route 1, so on our way back, we decided to try
                Route 2. After walking for a while, we reached a bridge over the
                Mandakini River. The bridge was narrow and quite old. We took a
                break by the river, and as we stepped off the bridge, we reached
                the riverbank. Large rocks were scattered in the river, and the
                sound of the water rushing over them created a beautiful,
                soothing melody. We spent some time there, clicking lots of
                pictures and capturing some really nice moments.

                quick chat with Aarti revealed that she and Madhu had stuck to
                Route 1 and were far ahead of us. They hadn't taken any breaks,
                so we picked up our pace. Shubha and Sohel moved ahead of us,
                while Saranya, Maneesh, and I walked together. Maneesh was
                having some difficulty walking, so we took short breaks to rest.
                At this point, our group was split into three: Aarti and Madhu

                exhausted. With just about one to one and a half kilometers
                left, I pushed ahead of Saranya and Maneesh. I was getting
                frustrated because the trek seemed never-ending, and my whole
                body was aching. Determined to finish, I walked the last
                kilometer without taking any breaks and reached Gaurikund by
                around 6:45 PM, where Sohel and Shubha were waiting for us at

                About 15 minutes later, Maneesh and Saranya also arrived at the

                There was a long line of people waiting to get from Gaurikund to
                Sonprayag. The HTC guides had already told us how to get back,
                so instead of waiting in line for three to four hours, we
                decided to walk out of Gaurikund and hitch a ride. We hadn't
                walked more than 100 meters when a vehicle stopped. We sent
                Shubha and Saranya ahead in that car. Five minutes later,
                another almost empty vehicle picked up the rest of us. This
                vehicle wasn't going to Gaurikund but was picking up passengers
                along the way, and it dropped us off at Sonprayag. Aarti and
                Madhu had already reached the room earlier.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                We reached Sonprayag before Shubha and Saranya, and once they
                arrived, we headed towards Sitapur, which was about a kilometer
                away. We walked for 20 to 25 minutes and reached our hotel in
                Sitapur by 9:00 PM. Dinner was arranged at the hotel. After
                changing and freshening up, we had dinner. The food that night
                was as good as it had been on previous days. We had walked about
                25 to 26 kilometers that day, and we were completely worn out.
                We took a bath and went to bed early, as we had to leave for
                Badrinath at 3:00 AM the next morning.

                We woke up at 3:00 AM and by 4:00 AM, we were ready and had left
                the hotel. Our traveling van was parked about a kilometer away,
                so we walked there with all our luggage, even though our legs
                were still sore and we'd only slept for about four hours. The
                van started moving towards Badrinath at 4:00 AM, and most of us
                fell asleep in our seats. The journey from Sitapur to Badrinath
                was about 210 kilometers, which would take around four hours if
                there was no traffic. We were supposed to pass through places
                like Phata, Ukhimath, Augustmuni, Rudraprayag, Karnaprayag,
                Gopeshwar, and Joshimath on our way.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                To pass the time in the van, we took some group photos, but
                overall, it was a bit boring. I had been dealing with a headache
                since the morning, probably due to a lack of sleep since the
                trip started. I wasn't sitting in the last seat of the van this
                time; Maneesh was sitting next to me, Sohel was behind us, and
                Shubha and Saranya were in the last row. At around 8:30 AM, we
                stopped for breakfast at a hotel named CRS Palace, about 10
                kilometers ahead of Karnaprayag. The hotel looked neat and
                clean, but the service was terrible. We ordered tea, poha, and
                paneer paratha. It took them about 20 minutes just to bring the
                poha, which was the worst I've ever had, and the tea arrived so
                late that most of us had already finished eating by then.

                After breakfast, we bought some water bottles and snacks and got
                back into the van. It was around 9:45 AM, and we still had half
                the journey left. To pass the time, everyone engaged in
                different discussions. Sohel and I started talking about songs,
                and during this chat, we decided to visit Mana Village before
                heading to Badrinath. Mana Village, known as the last village of
                India, is located just 2 kilometers from Badrinath on the same
                road. So, instead of stopping at Badrinath, we headed straight
                to Mana.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                We reached Mana Village by around 2:30 PM. The van dropped us
                off some distance away, so we walked the rest of the way. The
                weather was clear, with bright sunshine. As we walked, we saw a
                large glacier on both sides of the road, with water flowing onto
                the road. Some of us climbed over the glacier, while others
                carefully stepped on the rocks along the road. We took many
                photos together here. On the other side of the road, the
                Saraswati River was flowing, with snow-covered mountains
                surrounding the area, offering a breathtaking view.

                We continued exploring the village, where both sides of the path
                were lined with shops selling handmade woolen clothes. After
                some time, we reached a viewpoint overlooking the Saraswati
                River. We took memorable photos there, but the girls didn't feel
                like going any further because the path was steep. So, Maneesh,
                Sohel, and I continued on while the girls returned to the van.
                Further ahead, we found the origin point of the Saraswati River,
                which was an amazing sight—too bad the girls missed it.

                After exploring a bit more, we stopped for tea and momos, which
                were delicious. We then headed back to the van, stopping along
                the way to buy some wooden shawls. By the time we reached the
                van, it was already 4:30 PM. Everyone else was already there, so
                as soon as we arrived, the van started towards Badrinath. We
                reached Badrinath in just 10-15 minutes.

                There was a huge crowd at Badrinath, with a long line of people
                waiting for darshan at the temple. We were told to wait in front
                of the temple. We sat there, unsure of how we would manage to
                get darshan since it would take at least 4-5 hours if we stood
                in line, and the temple closes for darshan at 9:00 PM. We
                decided to wait outside the temple as Makhan, our guide, had
                arranged for a special entry with the priest, so we were assured
                we would get darshan in the evening. While waiting, we took many
                photos outside the temple. As darkness fell, the cold started to
                set in, and many of us weren't wearing warm clothes. Maneesh and
                Sohel went back to the van to get jackets and woolen caps, which
                finally brought us some relief.

                We sat there for about an hour and a half before we finally got
                to enter the temple. It was very crowded inside, and we barely
                had time to offer our prayers before we were ushered out in
                about five minutes. Afterward, Makhan asked us to pay 1100
                rupees per person for the special entry. We didn't realize at
                the time that this was the charge for the special entry. Saranya
                sent the payment via UPI, totaling 7700 rupees for all seven of
                us.

              <p className="sub-para">
                We then headed back to the van, stopping to buy shawls, jackets,
                gloves, and slippers along the way. It took us about an hour and
                a half before we were all back in the van. I was exhausted and
                fell asleep as soon as I sat down. About 20 minutes later,
                Maneesh woke me up, telling me we had reached the hotel. I
                thought he was joking because it felt like we had just left
                Badrinath, but the hotel was indeed close by, and we had arrived
                within 20 minutes. We had dinner at the hotel and then went
                straight to bed. After many days, we finally got a chance to
                sleep properly, and thus ended our fifth day of the trip.

                By 6:30 AM, we were ready to start the day, though some of our

                with some opting for Maggi and others for aloo paratha. Madhu,
                however, was surviving solely on Maggi; she didn't like anything
                else, and honestly, most of the group was struggling with the
                food—nothing on the menu from the northern region seemed to suit
                their tastes.

                on May 27th, so we started asking Shubha about her experience on
                the trip and what she thought of everyone. This led to a group
                discussion where each person shared their thoughts about the

                us to be dropped off there. I didn't have a reservation, and I
                was worried about how I'd get home in the heat. If I went to
                Delhi, I'd reach home comfortably. While I was lost in thought,
                Maneesh suggested I flip a coin to decide. The coin toss

                We got ready by 8:00 AM, and thankfully, Saranya was feeling
                better. She had been worried the night before, hoping that her
                fever would subside so she could join us for bungee jumping and
                rafting. At the hotel reception, we booked a rafting trip
                through a local guy who charged ₹700 per person for a
                12-kilometer stretch.

              <p className="sub-para">
                After booking, leaving our bags at the reception, we headed to a
                shop where we were supposed to meet up for the rafting. Our
                group of five was waiting for three more people to join. While
                we waited, we grabbed some breakfast. By 9:30 AM, we were on our
                way to the Ganga River for rafting, and by 10:00 AM, we were all
                geared up. A rafting guide joined us and gave instructions
                before we started. The river's current was strong, making the
                experience thrilling. No one fell into the water on their own,
                but the guide encouraged us to jump in, assuring us that our
                life jackets would keep us safe. Without hesitation, we jumped
                into the river, but one couple was hesitant. The guide playfully
                pushed them in, and once they hit the water, their fear
                disappeared.

                The most exciting parts were the sections of the river with many
                rocks and a fast current. It took us about 45 minutes to
                complete the rafting, although we suspected the distance wasn't
                quite the 12 kilometers as we were told. Afterward, we paid
                1500rs for photos and videos that the guide copied to our
                phones. We had a quick bite and were then driven back to the
                hotel.

                We changed our wet clothes and inquired about bungee jumping
                next. Renting three scooters, we set off from Tapovan towards
                Shivpuri (bungee jumping site), about 16 kilometers away from
                Tapovan. By 12:30 PM, we reached the bungee jumping site, where
                we chose the Free Style Bungee Jump, which cost ₹4800, including
                a video recording and photos. We filled out forms, had our
                weight measured, and received a stamp on our hands. An Omni van
                took us to the jump site.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                As we waited for our turn there, I was anxious, thinking about
                my 5:30 PM bus from Nepali Farm, which was about 25 kilometers
                away from Shivpuri. I was thinking about all this when we were
                asked to go up. Till now we were sitting below. We took a lift
                to the top, where the view was breathtaking—mountains all around
                and a river flowing through the valley.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                I decided to go first. The guide offered three options: run and
                jump off the platform, be tied with a rope and have the rope
                cut, or stand at the edge and be pushed off. I chose to run and
                jump. After they fitted me with a safety harness and explained a
                few signals to use for pulling me back up, I prepared to jump.

              </a>
              <p className="sub-para">
                If you're afraid of heights, bungee jumping might not be for
                you. Once you're up there, if you back out, there's no refund.
                They give you two chances to jump, and if you hesitate too long,
                they'll push you. The guide advised me not to look down while
                running—just keep my eyes on the horizon and jump on the third
                step. I was nervous but confident that everything would be fine.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                As I ran and jumped, there was a moment of sheer terror, like I
                might not make it, but it was an incredible experience. The rope
                bounced me up and down a few times before they threw down
                another rope for me to attach to my harness, signaling them to
                pull me up. After I was safely back up, they took photos.
                Maneesh and Sohel jumped next, both doing the running jump and
                nailing it on the first try without fear. Saranya chose the
                rope-cut method, which might be scarier since you're left
                dangling before the rope is cut. Aarti also opted for the
                rope-cut method, and both jumps went perfectly. We took some
                group photos with the site photographer before collecting our
                belongings from the locker room.

              <p className="sub-para">
                At around 4:15 PM, we left the site. I was in a hurry to return
                to Tapovan, return the scooter, grab my bag from the hotel, and
                head to the bus. I made it back quickly, returned the scooter
                and helmet, and picked up my bag from hotel. By then, it was
                around 4:40 PM, and I waited on the road for the others. Maneesh
                was supposed to drop me at Nepali Farm, but his scooter wasn't
                in good shape, so Sohel offered to take me. I said goodbye to
                everyone and set off with Sohel towards Nepali Farm.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                Google Maps showed two routes, and we chose the shorter one.
                However, traffic was heavy, and I was worried about missing my
                bus. I called the bus driver to let him know I might be 10
                minutes late and asked him not to leave without me. The driver
                agreed but told me not to be more than 10 minutes late. As
                traffic showed no signs of easing, we decided to take some
                smaller streets to bypass the main road, which worked out. Sohel
                drove as fast as possible and further ahead there was a railway
                crossing on the road which was closed. We had to stand there for
                5 minutes, after that we move ahead from there.
              </p>
              <p className="sub-para">
                Finally, we reached Nepali Farm by 5:50 PM, and I was relieved
                to see the bus still there. I thanked Sohel and boarded the bus,
                finding my seat at the back. The first thing I did was ask the
                conductor for water, which he brought me in 5 minutes, bringing
                me a sense of relief.

                I thought I would miss the bus when we were stuck in traffic,
                but thanks to Sohel, I made it. Buses from Rishikesh to Kanpur
                are rare, so I had booked this one to make my journey home
                easier. After Sohel dropped me off, he returned to Tapovan,
                where Maneesh, Aarti, and Saranya were waiting. They planned to
                attend the Ganga Aarti, but by the time they reached, the
                ceremony was over. They had dinner and then waited at the
                boarding point for their bus. The next day, they would all fly
                back to their respective homes from Delhi.
              </p>

              <p className="sub-para">
                Later, the Himalayan Bungee team sent us our photos and videos
                via WhatsApp. I posted that Bungee Jump video on Instagram and
                started replying to friend on Instagram. I thought how much more
                fun it would have been if Shubha and Madhu had stayed—they
                missed the most exciting part of the trip. At around 8:30 PM,
                the bus stopped at a hotel for dinner, where I ate and then went
                back to sleep on the bus, waking up the next morning. As I woke,
                I arrived home by 8:30 AM, and the others reached their homes
                later that evening.
